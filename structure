# How to use popART to play around with haplotype networks
# Create a .nexus file from Geneious (or whatever genetic software you are using)

# .nexus file should display information as below, where x is number of samples, or bases
#NEXUS
begin taxa;
	dimensions ntax=x;
	taxlabels
  sample_no_1 with some geneious text data
  sample_no_2 with some geneious text data
  ;
  end;
  
  begin characters;
	dimensions nchar=x;
	format datatype=dna missing=? gap=-;
	matrix
	sample_no_1
  CGGCACCCTATACTTGATCTTTGGTGCTTGAGCAGGGATAGTTGGTACTGGCCTTAGTCTG
  sample_no_2
  CGGCACCCTATACTTGATCTTTGGTGCTTGAGCAGGGATAGTTGGTACTGGCCTTAGTCTG
  ;
  end;
  
# the above file will throw errors in popART and will not load so you need to add trait data like below
BEGIN TRAITS;
Dimensions NTRAITS=3;
Format labels=yes missing=? separator=Comma;
TraitLabels location 1 location 2 location3;
Matrix
sample_no_1 1,0,0
sample_no_2 0,0,1
;
end;

# open popART, click File Open and choose edited nexus file, this will give you traits and alignment
# Click Network, then Median Joining Network to create a Haplotype network
# Click Edit to add or remove labels, change trait colours etc
# To save, click File, Save as to save nexus file
# to export images click file then export to pdf (this is the most usable form of the graphic)
